<h1>Personal Website V1 ðŸš€ðŸ”¥</h1>

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my portfolio website. This website isn't just my portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer & designer in the past few months, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

What I used:
- Visual Studio Code my ride-or-die
- Github Pages for easy push-to-deploy hosting
- Reactjs for a static site 
- Styled Components for less time-consuming and more modular CSS
- Flaticon/icons8 for images
- React Reveal for few animations
- Other than that A lot of Google and Stackoverflow!

Let me know what you think!
